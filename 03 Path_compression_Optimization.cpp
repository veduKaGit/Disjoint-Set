// The idea is to flatten the tree when find() is called. When find() is called for an element x, root of the tree is returned. 
// The find() operation traverses up from x to find root. 
// The idea of path compression is to make the found root as parent of x so that we donâ€™t have to traverse all intermediate nodes again. 
// If x is root of a subtree, then path (to root) from all nodes under x also compresses.


// Let the subset {0, 1, .. 9} be represented as below and find() is called for element 3.
//              9
//          /   |   \  
//         4    5    6
//        /         /  \
//       0         7    8
//      /        
//     3
//    / \         
//   1   2
// When find() is called for 3, we traverse up and find 9 as representative
// of this subset. With path compression, we also make 3 and 0 as the child of 9 so 
// that when find() is called next time for 0, 1, 2 or 3, the path to root is reduced.

//         --------9-------
//       /   /    /  \      \
//      0   4    5    6       3
